    "\n",

    "Control flow is the set of techniques that allows us to manage the way code is executed.\n",
    "For example, you might want to execute some code provided a certain condition is `True`.\n",
    "Or you might want to repeat a certain action a given number of times.\n",
    "Or, again, you might want to run code as long as a condition is `True`, but you do not know how many times the code should be executed before the condition turns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three examples are managed by the statements [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-if-statement), [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement) and [`while`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement).\n",
    "Here we see basic applications, just to convey the idea.\n",
    "We should keep in mind two things when working with control flow statements:\n",
    "- The control flow statement has to be on a line that end with a semicolon (`:`).\n",
    "- The code block following the control flow statements has to be indented with four whitespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` and `while` statements work provided that a certain condition holds.\n",

    "When working with collections (`lists`, `sets`, `dictionaries`, etc.) it is possible\n",

    "Defining a loop requires an iterable (in our example it is `sample_list`), which \n",
    "could be `list`, `tuple`, `set` or any other object that supports iteration. By\n",
    "specifying `item` we are asking python to iterate over one element of the list \n",
    "at a time, storing this element in a variable called `item`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operations that should be perfomed within the loop must be idented (typically with\n",

    "\n",
