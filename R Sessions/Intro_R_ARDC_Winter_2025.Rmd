# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (on Mac) or *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (on Windows).

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I* (on Mac) or *Ctrl+Alt+I* (on Windows).

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You can download and install packages with `install.packages("The name of package")`.

# Basic of learning

In this part we talk about basic elements of R programming.

## How to Print

```{r}

```

## Data Types (Classes)

In R, data types (or classes) define the kind of data stored in variables. Here are the most common data types in R:

| **Class**   | **Description**                            | **Example**              | **Code Example**                            |
|:--------------|:--------------------|:--------------|:---------------------|
| `numeric`   | Represents decimal or whole numbers        | 3.14, 42, -7.8           | `x <- 3.14; class(x)`                       |
| `character` | Represents text strings                    | "Hello", "R Programming" | `z <- "Hello"; class(z)`                    |
| `logical`   | Represents Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE)  | TRUE, FALSE              | `is_valid <- TRUE; class(is_valid)`         |
| `complex`   | Represents complex numbers                 | 2+3i, 1-4i               | `c <- 2 + 3i; class(c)`                     |
| `list`      | Represents a collection of different types | A list of numbers, text  | `lst <- list(1, "Hello", TRUE); class(lst)` |

```{r}

```

## Arithmetic Operators

| Symbol | Task Performed  |
|:------:|:---------------:|
|   \+   |    Addition     |
|   \-   |   Subtraction   |
|   /    |    division     |
|   \*   | multiplication  |
|  \*\*  | to the power of |
|   \^   | to the power of |
|   %%   |     modulus     |
|  %/%   | floor division  |

```{r}


```

**We can save values in variables:**

```{r}

```

In R programming, code runs line by line, with only the last assignment determining the final value of a variable.

```{r}

```

### Practice:

Convert a given temperature X degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit. $$F= C \cdot \frac{9}{5} + 32 $$

```{r}

```

## Relational Operators

|  Symbol  |      Task Performed      |
|:--------:|:------------------------:|
|   \<-    |        Assignment        |
|    =     |        Assignment        |
| assign() |        Assignment        |
|    ==    |   True, if it is equal   |
|    !=    |  True, if not equal to   |
|    \<    |        less than         |
|    \>    |       greater than       |
|   \<=    |  less than or equal to   |
|   \>=    | greater than or equal to |

```{r}

```

**you can use below command to get special values:**

```{r}

```

**you can write comment with \# :**

```{r}

```

**you can creat sequence numbers with below command:**

This work like *arange* in numpy pakage in Python

```{r}

```

This work like *linspace* in numpy pakage in Python

```{r}

```

Replicate function:

```{r}

```

## Practice:

Simulate GDP growth from the year 2000 to 2025 with an annual growth rate of 3% starting from 1000 units.

$$GDP_{t} = 1000 \cdot (1+r)^{n}$$

```{r}

```

## Loops

### if , elif

```{r}

```

### for loops

```{r}

```

### while loops

```{r}

```

**Use break and next in loops**

```{r}

```

### Practice:

Write a conditional statement to check whether the variable is positive, negative, or zero and print the appropriate message.

```{r}

```

## function

```{r}

```

### Practice I:

Write a function `temp()` that converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

```{r}

```

### Practice II:

Create a function `calculate_mean()` that takes a vector of numbers and returns their mean. Test the function with the vector `c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`.

```{r}

```

\newpage

# Vetors

The most common way to creat vectors is to use function `c()`.

```{r}

```

**Join vectors**

```{r}

```

You can find *lenght* of vectors with *lenght()* function:

```{r}

```

## Vector Indexing

```{r}

```

Use for loops for access to elemets of vectors

```{r}

```

Use index:

```{r}

```

## Matching Operator

```{r}

```

## Vector Arithmetic's

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Vector Methods

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Logical Vector

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Factors

-   Used to represent categorical data
-   Treated as integer vector, having a label
-   Factors are self describing

```{r}
x <- c('Male', "Female", "Male", 'Male', "Female")
```

## Mathematical Function in R

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Random Number in R

```{r}

```

## Practice:

Given a list of students `("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve")` and their corresponding scores `(85, 92, 78, 55, 88)`, extract the names and scores of students who passed (`score >= 60`). Also, calculate the mean score of the students who passed.

```{r}
students <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve")
scores <- c(85, 92, 78, 55, 88)
```

# Matrix

## Creat Matrix

Matrix are 2-dimentsional vectors and Dimensianal attribute is of lenght 2 (rows and columns). We should to know that Matrix contain elemts of same type.

```{r}

```

## Matrix diag

like `numpy.full` in python

```{r}

```

like `numpy.diag` in python

```{r}

```

for find the elements of diagonal of matrix:

```{r}

```

## Matrix: Naming Rows & Columns

```{r}

```

## Matrix Indexing

Indexing in R programming is similar to Python.

```{r}

```

You can change values in matrix.

```{r}

```

## Matrix: `rbine()` and `cbind()` functions

You can combine matrices with `rbine()` and `cbind()` functions.

At first, we want to combine the matrices from the row.

```{r}

```

After that, we want to combine the matrices from the columns.

```{r}

```

Relational Operators in Matrics:

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,1) , nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
B <- matrix(c(3,1,2,4,2,1,5,1,2), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)


```

Like `numpy.transpose()` or `.T` in python

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,1,4,2,3) , nrow=3, ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)

```

## Matrix Specific Functions

```{r}

```

## Practice I
Create a 4x4 matrix of random integers between 1 and 100.

- Print the matrix.
- Calculate the row-wise sum and column-wise mean.
- Check if the matrix is symmetric by comparing it to its transpose.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
mat <- matrix(sample(1:100, 16), nrow = 4)

```

## Practice II
Given a 3x3 matrix A of integers and a vector b = (30, 20, 15), solve the linear equation $A \cdot X=b$.
```{r}
set.seed(123)
A <- matrix(sample(1:10, 9, replace = TRUE), nrow = 3)
b <- c(30, 20, 15)

```

# Lists

## Creat list

`Lists` are also collecting of data and another kind of data storage. Lists can contain elemnts of any type of R object and these elements of list don't need be same type. You can creat list by using `list()` function.

```{r}

```

Creat list with vectors

```{r}

```

## List subset Operator

```{r}

```

## Lists Concatenation

```{r}

```
