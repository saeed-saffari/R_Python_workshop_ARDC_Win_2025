# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (on Mac) or *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (on Windows).

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y= mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size = 4)
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I* (on Mac) or *Ctrl+Alt+I* (on Windows).

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You can download and install packages with `install.packages("The name of package")`.

## Markdown:

$$\alpha = \beta = \frac{-\alpha \cdot \gamma^2}{\sqrt{\sigma^3}}$$

# Basic of learning

In this part we talk about basic elements of R programming.

## How to Print

```{r}
print('Hello world')
print("This is R programming Workshop!")
```

## Data Types (Classes)

In R, data types (or classes) define the kind of data stored in variables. Here are the most common data types in R:

| **Class**   | **Description**                            | **Example**              | **Code Example**                            |
|:--------------|:--------------------|:--------------|:---------------------|
| `numeric`   | Represents decimal or whole numbers        | 3.14, 42, -7.8           | `x <- 3.14; class(x)`                       |
| `character` | Represents text strings                    | "Hello", "R Programming" | `z <- "Hello"; class(z)`                    |
| `logical`   | Represents Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE)  | TRUE, FALSE              | `is_valid <- TRUE; class(is_valid)`         |
| `complex`   | Represents complex numbers                 | 2+3i, 1-4i               | `c <- 2 + 3i; class(c)`                     |
| `list`      | Represents a collection of different types | A list of numbers, text  | `lst <- list(1, "Hello", TRUE); class(lst)` |

```{r}
print(class(3.14))
print(class('R programming'))
print(class(TRUE))
```

## Arithmetic Operators

| Symbol | Task Performed  |
|:------:|:---------------:|
|   \+   |    Addition     |
|   \-   |   Subtraction   |
|   /    |    division     |
|   \*   | multiplication  |
|  \*\*  | to the power of |
|   \^   | to the power of |
|   %%   |     modulus     |
|  %/%   | floor division  |

```{r}
18 + 4
18 - 4
18 * 4
18 / 4
2 ** 3
2 ^ 3
18 %% 4
18 %/% 4
log(2)
log10(2)
```
```{r}
5 + (4 - 3 * 2)**3 + 1
```

**We can save values in variables:**

```{r}
x <- 18
y = 4
z <- x + y
print(z)
class(z)
```


In R programming, code runs line by line, with only the last assignment determining the final value of a variable.

```{r}
a = 5 + (4 - 3 * 2)**3 + 1
a = 10
a = a * 2
a = a - 5
a
```

### Practice:

Convert a given temperature X degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit. 
$$F= C \cdot \frac{9}{5} + 32 $$

```{r}
temp = 20
fahrenheit <- (temp * 9 / 5) + 32
print(fahrenheit)
```

## Relational Operators

|  Symbol  |      Task Performed      |
|:--------:|:------------------------:|
|   \<-    |        Assignment        |
|    =     |        Assignment        |
| assign() |        Assignment        |
|    ==    |   True, if it is equal   |
|    !=    |  True, if not equal to   |
|    \<    |        less than         |
|    \>    |       greater than       |
|   \<=    |  less than or equal to   |
|   \>=    | greater than or equal to |

```{r}
z <- 10
y = 6
assign('x', 2)

x < y
x >= y
x != y
x == y

x > 2
x >= 2


x > 1 & y < 10
x > 1 & y > 10

x > 1 | y > 10
```

**you can use below command to get special values:**

```{r}
x <- pi
x

e <- exp(1)
e

x <- letters
x

x <- LETTERS
x

x <- month.name
x

x <- month.abb
x
```

**you can write comment with \# :**

```{r}
# This line is comment!
r = 0.2 # interest rate
```

**you can create sequence numbers with below command:**

This work like *arange* in numpy pakage in Python

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x

x <- 1:10 * 2
x

x <- seq(5)
x

x <- seq(from=1, to=9)
x

x <- seq(from=1, to=9, by=3)
x

x <- seq(1,10,2)
x
```

This work like *linspace* in numpy pakage in Python

```{r}
x <- seq(1,10,length = 5)
x
```

Replicate function:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
x

y <- rep(x, time = 5)
y

y <- rep(x, each = 5)
y
```

## Practice:

Simulate GDP growth from the year 2000 to 2025 with an annual growth rate of 3% starting from 1000 units.

$$GDP_{t} = 1000 \cdot (1+r)^{n}$$

```{r}
years = 2000:2025
growth_rate <- 0.03 # rate
GDP = 1000 * (1+growth_rate)**(years - 2000)
GDP
```

## Loops

### if , elif

```{r}
"R" + 2
```

```{r}
age <- 15
if (age >= 18){
  print('You are old enough to vote!')
} else {
  print('You can NOT vote yet!')
  print(paste('You can will vote after ', 18 - age, ' years.'))
}
```

```{r}
age <- 16
if (age <= 4){
  price = 0
} else if (age < 16){
  price = 50
} else if (age >= 16){
  price = 100
}

print(paste("Your cost is $", price))
```


### for loops

```{r}
for (i in 1:5){
  print(i)
}
```
```{r}
for (i in 1:5){
  print(i*i)
}
```
```{r}
z = 0
for (i in 1:10){
  z = z + i
  print(z)
}
```



### while loops

```{r}
i <- 1
while (i < 10){
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

### Practice:

Write a conditional statement to check whether the variable is positive, negative, or zero and print the appropriate message.


```{r}

```


## function

```{r}

```

### Practice I:

Write a function `temp()` that converts a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

```{r}

```

### Practice II:

Create a function to calculate the **future value** \( K_n \) of an investment after `n` years with a given principal \( K \) and interest rate \( r \).  

The formula for compound interest is:
$$K_n = K \times (1 + r)^n$$
```{r}

```

### Practice III:

Write a function in R that takes a number as input and returns whether the number is even or odd.

```{r}

```

# Vetors

The most common way to create vectors is to use function `c()`.

```{r}

```

**Join vectors**

```{r}

```

You can find *lenght* of vectors with *lenght()* function:

```{r}

```

## Vector Indexing

```{r}

```

Use for loops for access to elemets of vectors

```{r}

```

Use index:

```{r}

```

## Matching Operator

```{r}

```

## Vector Arithmetic's

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Vector Methods

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Logical Vector

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Factors

-   Used to represent categorical data
-   Treated as integer vector, having a label
-   Factors are self describing

```{r}
x <- c('Male', "Female", "Male", 'Male', "Female")
```

## Mathematical Function in R

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Random Number in R

```{r}

```

## Practice:

Given a list of students `("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve")` and their corresponding scores `(85, 92, 78, 55, 88)`, extract the names and scores of students who passed (`score >= 60`). Also, calculate the mean score of the students who passed.

```{r}
students <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve")
scores <- c(85, 92, 78, 55, 88)
```

# Matrix

## Creat Matrix

Matrix are 2-dimentsional vectors and Dimensianal attribute is of lenght 2 (rows and columns). We should to know that Matrix contain elemts of same type.

```{r}

```

## Matrix diag

like `numpy.full` in python

```{r}

```

like `numpy.diag` in python

```{r}

```

for find the elements of diagonal of matrix:

```{r}

```

## Matrix: Naming Rows & Columns

```{r}

```

## Matrix Indexing

Indexing in R programming is similar to Python.

```{r}

```

You can change values in matrix.

```{r}

```

## Matrix: `rbine()` and `cbind()` functions

You can combine matrices with `rbine()` and `cbind()` functions.

At first, we want to combine the matrices from the row.

```{r}

```

After that, we want to combine the matrices from the columns.

```{r}

```

Relational Operators in Matrics:

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,1) , nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
B <- matrix(c(3,1,2,4,2,1,5,1,2), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)


```

Like `numpy.transpose()` or `.T` in python

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,1,4,2,3) , nrow=3, ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)

```

## Matrix Specific Functions

```{r}

```

## Practice I
Create a 4x4 matrix of random integers between 1 and 100.

- Print the matrix.
- Calculate the row-wise sum and column-wise mean.
- Check if the matrix is symmetric by comparing it to its transpose.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
mat <- matrix(sample(1:100, 16), nrow = 4)

```

## Practice II
Given a 3x3 matrix A of integers and a vector b = (30, 20, 15), solve the linear equation $A \cdot X=b$.
```{r}
set.seed(123)
A <- matrix(sample(1:10, 9, replace = TRUE), nrow = 3)
b <- c(30, 20, 15)

```

# Lists

## Creat list

`Lists` are also collecting of data and another kind of data storage. Lists can contain elemnts of any type of R object and these elements of list don't need be same type. You can creat list by using `list()` function.

```{r}

```

Creat list with vectors

```{r}

```

## List subset Operator

```{r}

```
